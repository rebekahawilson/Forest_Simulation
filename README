Simulation of forest growth and development using a 2D grid.
Each cell represents either an empty space, a young tree, a mature tree, or a dead tree.
It factors in seed dispersal (reproduction from trees).

The simulation updates over time using simple rules: 
    - empty spaces can grow young trees with a certain probability 
    - young trees can mature,
    - and mature trees may eventually die

Ideas for expansion / adding more complexity:
- Add different tree species
- Add environmental factors (sunlight, wind, rain, etc.)
- Add a fire simulation
- Add tree ageing
- Add competition for resources
- Add more realistic visualisation (textures, shading, etc for different stages of tree-life and environmental factors)
- Add user interaction element (so user can control different parameters)
